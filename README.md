# Twist

A simple build tool for wrangling your ES Module static import paths.

## Install

```bash
npm i -S @codewithkyle/twist
```

## Usage

By default we will look for JavaScript/TypeScript files in the `src/` directory and will output to the `public/js` directory. If you do not provide a `--config` flag we will use the esbuild options displayed in the example below.

```json
// package.json
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "twist --src=./path-to/source --outdir=./public/js --config=./esbuild.config.js"
    }
}
```

```javascript
// esbuild.config.js -- https://esbuild.github.io/api/
module.exports = {
    bundle: false,
    minify: true,
    format: "esm",
    target: "es2020",
}
```

## Breaking Changes

This project includes [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) as one of its primary dependencies. Esbuild has **not** shipped a v1.0.0 meaning that minor releases can contain breaking changes.

**What does this mean for anyone using this library?**

It means that minor releases for this library may contain an esbuild update that introduces breaking changes.

**How to avoid breaking changes?**

Option 1: Make sure this library does not contain the `^` character in the version number within your `package.json` file. This will force NPM to download the specified version instead of downloading the latest version whenever you perform the `npm update` or `npm install` commands. When you need to update this library you will need to manually adjust the libraries version number within your `packages.json` file after reading through the [our changelog](https://github.com/codewithkyle/twist/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) looking for esbuild updates. Before you update we suggest you need to read through the [esbuild changelog](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and look for any breaking changes that they've introduced.

Opiton 2: Accept that esbuild is under development and try to limit your use of their experimental build tools or API features. Also, thoroughly test everything whenever you update this library.
